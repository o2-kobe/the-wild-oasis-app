/*In react-query, the QueryClient can be configured with a variety of options to customize its behavior. Besides staleTime, here are some other options you can set in the defaultOptions for queries and mutations:

Query Options
cacheTime: The time for which inactive queries remain in the cache before being garbage collected.
refetchOnMount: Determines if a query should automatically refetch when the component mounts.
refetchOnWindowFocus: Controls whether a query should refetch when the window regains focus.
refetchInterval: Sets an interval (in milliseconds) for automatically refetching the query.
retry: The number of retry attempts for a failed query.
retryDelay: The time delay (in milliseconds) between retries for failed queries.
onSuccess: A callback function that is called when a query is successful.
onError: A callback function that is called when a query fails.
onSettled: A callback function that is called when a query is either successful or fails.
Mutation Options
Similarly, you can set options specifically for mutations like onSuccess, onError, onSettled, and retry as well.
Remembering the Options
Here are a few easy ways to remember the key options for QueryClient:

Group by Functionality: Organize your options into categories: caching (e.g., staleTime, cacheTime), refetching behavior (e.g., refetchOnMount, refetchOnWindowFocus, refetchInterval), and callbacks for success/error handling (e.g., onSuccess, onError).

Mnemonics: Create a mnemonic for the options you use most frequently. For example, "CEST" for Cache (cacheTime), Expiry (staleTime), Success (onSuccess), and Timeout (retryDelay).

Documentation Reference: Keep the official react-query documentation bookmarked for quick reference. Familiarize yourself with its structure, as it's organized logically.

Practice: Implement and modify example code snippets to solidify your understanding. As you try different options, the usage will become more intuitive.

Code Comments: When you create a project or snippets, add comments to your configuration options explaining what each does. This helps reinforce memory by providing context.

Here's a sample code snippet with additional options for better clarity:

Copy
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 60 * 1000,
      cacheTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Keep inactive data for 5 minutes
      refetchOnMount: false,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
      refetchInterval: 10000, // Refetch every 10 seconds
      retry: 1, // Retry once on failure
      onSuccess: (data) => {
        console.log("Query was successful:", data);
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        console.error("Query failed:", error);
      },
    },
  },
});
Experimenting with the options and referencing the documentation will help solidify your understanding of how to maximize the potential of react-query.

if we do not specify or give values to some of the options, then what is their default values

Reasoning Process

In React Query, if you donâ€™t explicitly specify values for certain options, the library uses its own sensible defaults. Here are the default values for common options in queries:

Query Defaults
Option	Default Value
staleTime	0 (data is considered stale immediately after fetching)
cacheTime	5 * 60 * 1000 (5 minutes; inactive queries stay cached for 5 minutes)
refetchOnMount	true (refetch when component mounts)
refetchOnWindowFocus	true (refetch when window regains focus)
refetchOnReconnect	true (refetch when network reconnects)
retry	3 (retry failed queries 3 times)
retryDelay	Exponential backoff: (attempt) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attempt, 30000)
refetchInterval	false (no automatic refetching unless explicitly set)
enabled	true (queries run automatically)
onSuccess/onError	undefined (no default callbacks)
Example with Defaults Explicitly Shown
Copy
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 0, // Default
      cacheTime: 300000, // 5 minutes (default)
      refetchOnMount: true, // Default
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true, // Default
      retry: 3, // Default
      // Other options not specified use their defaults
    },
  },
});
Key Takeaways:
Stale Data: By default, data is marked stale immediately (staleTime: 0), which triggers refetching in the background under conditions like window focus.
Caching: Unused queries stay cached for 5 minutes (cacheTime) to avoid unnecessary refetches for inactive components.
Refetch Behavior: React Query aggressively refetches by default (on mount, window focus, etc.) to keep data fresh.
Retry Logic: Failed queries retry 3 times with exponential backoff delays (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s).
How to Remember:
Defaults prioritize freshness: React Query assumes you want up-to-date data, so it aggressively refetches unless you override options like staleTime.
Think in categories:
Caching: staleTime, cacheTime.
Refetch Triggers: refetchOnMount, refetchOnWindowFocus.
Error Handling: retry, retryDelay. */
